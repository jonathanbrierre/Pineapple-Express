# Pineapple Express

Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view this project of mine. Pineapple Express is a store designed for demo purposes ONLY! It is in no way meant to sell actual products. It is also in no way related to the movie 'Pineapple Express,' or the apparel store, EXPRESS (don't sue me ðŸ¥°). It is a store front designed to simulate the online shopping process whilst also showcasing different CSS and SCSS mechanics. 

# Getting Started

* Run `bundle install` on your computer to install the necesary ruby gems.

* Run `rails db:migrate` to run the migration files and set up your database.

* Run `rails db:seed` to seed the database with the store items (because what's a store without any items!?).

* After the above 3 steps are complete, you can start your rails server using the command, `rails s`. 

* Once the server is running ( give it a few moments - maybe 7.23 seconds), access the store home page by typing `localhost:3000` into the URL bar in your browser.

* Buy all the things!
